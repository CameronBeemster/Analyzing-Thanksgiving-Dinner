# Analyzing-Thanksgiving-Dinner

Hello! Thank you for checking out my project.

This notebook is for a project I did while learning data science/analytics with Dataquest (https://www.dataquest.io). 
The goal of this project was to practice using the Pandas Python library for data analysis. The dataset is from a survey 
about Thanksgiving dinner and was provided by FiveThirtyEight (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight).
